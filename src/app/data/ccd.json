        "Challenge Summary": "The accumulation of scrap on one side of the bin due to uneven distribution from the conveyor system leads to inefficient use of space and potential overflow issues. This challenge necessitates a solution for balanced scrap distribution within the bin to optimize operations and reduce waste.",

As a result, one side of the bin becomes overloaded while the other remains underutilized. This imbalance not only wastes valuable space but also poses risks of overflow, which can disrupt operations and increase labor costs associated with manual redistribution."
