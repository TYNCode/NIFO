                Confidential Information Receiving Party obtained from the
                Disclosing Party. However, nothing contained herein will be

                information maintained in compliance with its digital data
                retention and automated backup procedures provided that such

                <strong>Remedies:</strong> In the event of a breach of this
                section 14, the Receiving Party understands and agrees that
                direct money damages may not be an adequate remedy for any
                breach of these Terms by it and that the Disclosing Party may be
                entitled (without exclusion of other remedies herein) to seek
                specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as
                a remedy for any such breach. The Receiving Party further agrees
                to waive any requirement for the Disclosing Party to secure or
                post any bond in connection with such remedy.
              </li>

                Parties.

            </h2>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
              In the event of a breach of the Resale Restriction in section 5,
              the Parties agree that money damages may not be an adequate
              remedy. Accordingly, in the event of such breach, you agree that
              we will be entitled (without exclusion of other remedies herein,
              including monetary remedies) to seek specific performance and
              injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such
              breach, including disgorgement of profits. You further agree to
              waive any requirement that Nifo secure or post any bond in
              connection with such remedy. You further agree that should we
              prevail in a suit in which we assert violation of the Resale
              Restriction, you will pay our reasonable attorneys’ fees and
              costs, including costs of investigation.
